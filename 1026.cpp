// A Ming felt that his computer was often posted randomly by friends when it was left at school, 
// so he wanted to write a password verification program to protect his privacy.
// He didn't want to make his password too complex in case he forgot and couldn't log in, 
// so the password only contained numbers.
// He also doesnâ€™t want to be like a cash machine, which locks the card 
// after entering the wrong password more than three times, 
// so he hopes that the program can try the password an unlimited number of times until the correct password is entered.
// Can you help him design this program so that his friends can no longer steal his computer and post?
